## Installation

See the [releases page](https://github.com/devnote-dev/crimson/releases/latest) for available releases.

### From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devnote-dev/crimson
cd crimson
shards build
```

## Usage

To get started, simply run `crimson setup`. This will setup the necessary configuration files and directories for Crimson, update your system to make the `crystal` and `shards` executables available and prompt you to install the necessary build dependencies for Crystal. You can bypass the prompts by including the `-y`/`--yes` flag, or skip dependency installation by including the `-s`/`--skip-dependencies` flag.

> **Note** Crystal's dependencies are not typically readily available on most systems so you will need to install them manually if you choose to skip them in the command.

Next, install Crystal using `crimson install`. By default this will install the latest available version unless you specify one (for example, `crimson install 1.9.2`). You can install any Crystal version that is available on the [Crystal GitHub releases page](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases). This unfortunately means that nightly builds cannot be installed via Crimson yet.

Finally, run the `crimson switch <version>` command to make that version of Crystal available on your system. You can also do this automatically by including the `-s`/`--switch` flag in `crimson install`. Now, try `crystal version`! To put this in perspective, you just setup and installed Crystal with 3 simple commands:

```sh
crimson setup
crimson install 1.9.2
crimson switch 1.9.2
```

### Aliases

Versions can be aliased to make using them easier: run `crimson alias <name> <version>` to set an alias for a specific version (for example, `crimson alias dev 1.9.2`). You can view all aliases with `crimson alias` and delete an alias with `crimson alias -d <name>`. Aliases can also be set automatically by including the `-a`/`--alias` flag.

### Switching

You can switch between Crystal versions using `crimson switch <version>`. If the version you wish to switch to has an alias, you can use that instead (for example, `crimson switch dev`). Versions can also be switched to automatically in the install command by including the `-s`/`--switch` flag.

### Defaults

What if you frequently install or switch versions and need a default available? You can set one using `crimson default <version>`. This also supports using aliases in place of the version.

But how exactly does it work? Lets say you have `1.9.2` as default and you're working with version `1.7.3` but no longer need it, so you remove it. Crimson will automatically switch back to the configured default so that you still have a version of Crystal available on your system.

You can also easily switch between your current and default version using `crimson switch .` which will set the former to the latter. Defaults can be removed using `crimson default -d`.

### Removing

Removing Crystal versions is as simple as `crimson remove <version>`, and you can use the alias in place of the version.

### Useful Tricks

All the above commands can be combined via flags in the install command:

```sh
crimson install -sa dev 1.9.2
#                ^^
#                /\
#     switch to /  set the alias to "dev"
#  this version

crimson install -fd
# install the latest version and make it the default

crimson install -a legacy -ds 1.0.0
#                ^         ^^
#  set the alias /         |\ switch to this version
#  to "legacy"             \
#                           make it the default
```

### Side Notes

Crimson caches available versions locally from the [Crystal API](https://crystal-lang.org/api/versions.json) so if newer releases don't appear as available via Crimson, run the install command with the `-f`/`--fetch` flag which will force-check the API and cache newer versions. If that doesn't work, check the API as it's likely it hasn't been updated to include the newer versions yet.
